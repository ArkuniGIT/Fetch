  # Summary

This is a project used to showcase how I would make an app in Next.js using external APIs. With the app, users browse pictures of preferred dog breed and pin their favorites with a small comment.

# Overview
This is a short overview of the different high-level components the app will be made of. The app will be divided into pages and more loosely coupled elements like modals, sidebars and the top-level layout component.

## Layout
Every page will be contained inside the layout element.

## Landing page
A basic page that introduces the app.

## Breed list page
A page where the user chooses a dog breed from a list.

## Dog collection page
A page that shows pictures of the selected dog breed.

## Pin modal
A modal that contains a form which lets the user attach a comment to the picture they want to pin.

## Sidebar
A sidebar where all pinned dogs will be visible and can be unpinned.

# Libraries

Next.js will be used because that is the entire point of this showcase. üòÅ

SWR will be used to handle remote fetching because it also handles state management of the fetched resources.

Material-UI will be used as the designated design framework and provide all visual components. It saves a lot of time and deals with strange browser specific behaviour.

js-cookie will be used to handle cookies which will be used to persist pinned dogs.

Cypress will be used for End-2-End testing. It might be a bit overkill, but even small silly dog apps deserves testing!
